# Kubernetes Workshop Prerequisites

1. Sign up for IBM Cloud here: https://cloud.ibm.com/login
The type of account in use will be a Lite or Trial account. We will have promo codes available if upgrades are needed.
To avoid any potential problems, I advise using a personal or gmail address rather than an ibm.com address to create a basic account.
This will be more in line with a developer's perspective and avoid any SSO or internal type of complications

2. Sign up for Katacoda here: https://www.katacoda.com/signup
To sign up, enter in new information (email address and password) check the "Robot" box and click on "Sign Up For Free."
